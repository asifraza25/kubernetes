core DNS ?? 

    - kubernetes have it's own internal DNS system.
    - service IP can be changed. So we use coreDNS for internal communication of pods.
        $ kubectl get po -n kube-system | grep coredns
    - check the /etc/resolve.conf file of pods. It has coredns service ip 
        $ kubectl get service -n kube-system 
        $ kubectl describe service -n kube-system | grep -i end 
        $ kubectl get po -o wide -n kube-system | grep -i core

    - DNS entry syntax of core dns.

        - create a pod with dnsutils.search pods yaml file on kubernetes.io with name dnsutils.
        - Now, create pod and run nslookup from inside pod.

        DNS naming syntax is - ServiceName.NamespaceName.svc.cluster.local
        SVC: ServiceName.NamespaceName.svc.cluster.local
