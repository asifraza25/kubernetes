Label & selector meaning in pod.yml and rc.yml ?

Lab1: Deploy three pods with three different labels(like red, green, yellow) and names(pod1, pod2, pod3) using pod.yaml files.

$ kubectl get pod --show-labels

$ kubectl get po -l color=red

Lab2: Rc.yml similarly labels are applied on RC 


Selector ??

Lab3: Create a pod with pod.yml and label it as nginx with xyz name
      Now create three pod with RC with same label nginx and selector nginx.

      Now only two pod will launch and pre-existing pods will be included in RC.
      Because RC create pod with selector and label of RC files.

      - delete pod xyz pod. RC will automatically create pods. 
      - 

      $ kubectl describe pod xyz | grep controll  
      $ kubectl get po --show-labels
      $ kubectl get po -l 
      $ kubectl delete pod --all
